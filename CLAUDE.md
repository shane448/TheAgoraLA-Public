# The Agora LA Development Guide

## Project Map

- `TheAgoraLA.xcodeproj`: open this project for the iOS app.
- `Sources/`: active SwiftUI application code.
- `TheAgoraLA/`: app resources, `Info.plist`, privacy manifest, and assets.
- `Backend/`: Node.js cloud analysis API and worker deployed to Railway.
- `Website/`: public support, privacy, terms, and OpenRouter return pages.
- `AppStore/`: release metadata, review notes, and submission checklists.

The old standalone podcast prototype and third-party sample recording are intentionally excluded from this public repository. They are not dependencies of the current app.

## Product Behavior

`Import, Analyze & Save` is the single episode workflow. It resolves a supported podcast URL, obtains or creates the transcript, prepares the summary, selects high-quality transcript-grounded questions, generates expected answers from podcast evidence, schedules prompts after the relevant passages, and saves the complete episode.

Listeners use their own OpenRouter account. Never add an Agora-owned AI key to the app or repository. Provider credentials must remain encrypted and short-lived in cloud jobs, and must never be logged.

## Verification

Run backend checks:

```bash
cd Backend
npm ci
npm run check
```

Run website checks:

```bash
cd Website
npm ci
npm test
```

Build the iOS app:

```bash
xcodebuild -project TheAgoraLA.xcodeproj \
  -scheme TheAgoraLA \
  -configuration Debug \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  build
```

## Engineering Guardrails

- Preserve the one-button import, analysis, prompt generation, and save flow.
- Questions and expected answers must be grounded in the complete transcript, not stock templates.
- Prompt playback times must occur after the listener has heard all supporting evidence.
- Keep long podcast analysis resumable through the cloud job system.
- Do not commit `.env` files, provider keys, signing keys, provisioning profiles, Xcode user state, build products, or `node_modules`.
- Maintain iOS 16 compatibility unless the deployment target is intentionally changed.
- Run the relevant checks before committing changes.
